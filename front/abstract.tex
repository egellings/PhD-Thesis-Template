\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}

This is the shell of the template that I adapted from various sources to write my PhD thesis. I deleted most packages that were not necessary to use this template. Below, I have listed some of the packages that you may find useful.

Scientific:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx}{siunitx}}: consistent typography of numbers and units
	\item \textbf{\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/chemformula}{chemformula}}: typeset chemical formulas and reactions
	\item \textbf{\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/physics}{physics}}: more options to typeset equations (vector calculus, bra-ket,...)
\end{itemize}

General Use:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/cleveref}{cleveref}}: for prettier references in the text
	\item \textbf{\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/todonotes}{todonotes}}: mark things that need attention
\end{itemize}

Remember that you need to run \texttt{pdflatex, biber, pdflatex, pdflatex} if you are using a bibliography.

If you're curious about the actual thesis, you can find it on \textbf{\href{https://www.tdx.cat/handle/10803/668853}{tdx.cat}}. The final product looks a bit different than this template due to last-minute tweaks to reduce the page number.

Any questions or comments? Please leave them on github:
